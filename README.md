# CoupledDynamics2_layeruse

Files to run the stochastic model to compare the value of information on local infection in an individual's "communication" layer versus their "infection" layer.  Full results can be produced by running the three scripts:

ScriptForPaper2a_nv.R
ScriptForPaper2b_nv.R
ScriptForPaper2c_nv.R

Plots from the paper can be reproduced using the code

Paper2Plotting.R

The branches contain elements of the code to run the simulations in parallel on high performance computing clusters
